Software Product Lifecycle Management
=====================================

Approach
--------

Fundamentally, a product lifecycle involves a series of stages with various necessary checkpoints. We recognize this and provide a customizable method for managing the state of projects within a software product that ensure a repeatable process with fewer missed steps and a more predictable outcome, starting time, and hopefully release.

Ideas/ToDos
-----------

- Templates (request what template to use on add, edit templates in settings)
- Adding/removing sections and items (from template or active project)
- Colors for each card
- Display modes (user pref, local storage) that control how dense the display is -- to cover different use cases and problems.
  - high-level overview (progress bar only per project)
  - status view (progress bar for each sub-stage)
  - all (full checklist w/ progress at top and sub-levels)
  - worklist (pivot to a list of next actions by project order for projects/actions assigned to yourself with immediate next action called out big and bold)
  - calendar / planning mode (gantt or calendar; view timeline & expected/goal delivery date, call out discrepancies)
